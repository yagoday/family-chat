# Backend Structure Document: Family Chat Application

## Introduction

The backend of the Family Chat Application is the engine that powers all the real-time interactions and data management behind the scenes. It handles user authentication, message storage, real-time messaging via WebSocket, and image processing. This core system is designed with reliability, simplicity, and security in mind to support a safe and engaging experience for family members. Every part of the system works together to create a smooth, fast, and secure chat platform where families can share texts, emojis, and images without complications.

## Backend Architecture

At the heart of our system is a Node.js application built with Express and written in TypeScript. The architecture is layered, meaning it separates various tasks like handling HTTP requests, processing WebSocket connections, and interacting with the database. Real-time communication is managed by Socket.io, which allows live chat and instant updates when users send messages or images. By using this modular design, the backend remains easy to update and scale as more family members join or as new features are added. The combination of RESTful API endpoints for authentication and data retrieval alongside WebSocket for real-time messaging ensures that performance and user experience are both top priorities.

## Database Management

The application relies on a PostgreSQL database for storing user details and messages. Tables are carefully structured—with one table for users and another for messages—to enable efficient data storage and retrieval. The user table stores essential information like a unique ID, username, password hash, and profile details, while the messages table records message content, image URLs, and timestamps to maintain a clear chat history. We use TypeORM to handle communication with the database, which simplifies the process of making table migrations and ensures that data is stored consistently and securely. A command-line script is provided for the administrator to pre-register users with securely hashed passwords using bcrypt.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend offers a set of clear API endpoints designed to allow seamless communication between the frontend and the server. Authentication is handled via a RESTful endpoint at `/api/auth/login` where users send their username and password, and on successful validation, receive a JWT token along with their user information. For handling messages, there is an endpoint to retrieve past chat history (`GET /api/messages`) with support for pagination, and endpoints to post new messages (`POST /api/messages`) or to upload images (`POST /api/messages/upload`). These endpoints ensure that data flows smoothly, whether users are logging in, sending a text message, or sharing a JPEG image, which can be resized if needed before being stored through Cloudinary integration.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on Railway.app, an efficient cloud-based hosting solution that is great for continuous deployment and scaling. Railway.app provides an integrated environment where the Node.js server, PostgreSQL database, and even the frontend are deployed together, reducing configuration hassles and allowing for rapid updates. This platform supports the reliability and scalability we need, ensuring that family members can access the chat securely and without interruption whether there are just a few users or many.

## Infrastructure Components

The system’s infrastructure combines several integrated components that enhance performance and user experience. A load balancer helps distribute incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests, ensuring that no single server becomes a bottleneck. A caching mechanism may be used to speed up frequently requested data, and with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) provided by Railway.app, static assets such as images and scripts are delivered quickly. Additionally, the integration with Cloudinary for image storage means that pictures are processed and delivered efficiently, keeping the chat experience smooth even when handling large images.

## Security Measures

Security is central to the backend's design. All sensitive communications take place over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted end-to-end. Users authenticate via JWT tokens, which are verified on every API and WebSocket request, maintaining constant secured interaction. Passwords are stored securely using bcrypt hashing, protecting user credentials from potential breaches. Moreover, input validation and sanitization are applied to all user data, which helps prevent common vulnerabilities. Together, these measures work to safeguard the system and protect the privacy of every family member using the chat application.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Even though integral logging and advanced analytics were not a primary requirement, basic tools are in place to monitor server health and performance. The hosting platform, Railway.app, offers built-in monitoring features that help track uptime and respond to any unforeseen issues. Maintenance tasks such as applying security patches, updates to dependencies, and routine database migrations are scheduled regularly. This proactive approach ensures the backend remains reliable, secure, and up-to-date over time.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend structure of the Family Chat Application is purposefully designed to support a fast, secure, and engaging environment for family communication. With a Node.js and Express setup powered by Socket.io and secured with JWT and bcrypt, every aspect of the backend—from API endpoints to database management—is optimized for smooth real-time messaging. Hosting on Railway.app ensures that the system is both scalable and cost-effective, while integration with Cloudinary simplifies image handling. Overall, the backend is a robust, well-organized system that not only meets the project’s requirements but also lays a solid foundation for future expansion and improvement.
