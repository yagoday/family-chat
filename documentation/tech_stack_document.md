# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This document explains the technology choices behind our Family Chat Application. The application is a real-time chat platform specifically designed for family members to communicate safely and efficiently. It features a bright, kid-friendly design and an intuitive interface for sending text messages, emojis, and images. Our technology choices aim to provide a secure, reliable, and enjoyable experience for users on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

## Frontend Technologies

Our frontend is built with React and TypeScript, which together create a modern and responsive user interface. React enables dynamic updates to the screen so that when messages are sent or received, the chat updates automatically. TypeScript adds an extra layer of reliability by catching errors before they reach the user. For styling, we have chosen Material-UI or Tailwind CSS because they help design a colorful and simple interface that is both engaging and easy to navigate. The emoji-mart library is integrated to allow users to easily pick and insert emojis, and the Cloudinary React SDK helps seamlessly display images in the chat. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend, and Socket.io-client ensures smooth real-time communication between the userâ€™s browser and our server.

## Backend Technologies

Our backend uses Node.js with Express, providing a reliable environment to handle requests and manage data transfers. We use TypeScript here as well to maintain code quality and catch potential issues early. The server incorporates Socket.io to manage live chat sessions, ensuring that messages are broadcast in real-time to all connected users. For data storage, we use PostgreSQL, a robust and secure database hosted on Railway.app that stores user details and chat history. TypeORM helps manage the interactions with the database through well-organized code. Authentication is handled using JWT tokens, which secure communication between the client and server, while bcrypt is used to hash passwords, adding an important layer of security to protect user credentials.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The entire application is hosted on Railway.app, which simplifies the deployment of both our backend and frontend, as well as our PostgreSQL database. Railway.app makes it easy to scale the system and manage updates. The deployment process is streamlined using continuous integration and continuous deployment practices that work seamlessly with our version control system. This infrastructure choice helps to ensure that the application remains reliable and available, even as traffic grows or new features are added.

## Third-Party Integrations

Several third-party services are integrated to enhance the application. Cloudinary is used for image storage and processing; it not only stores images but also automatically shrinks them if they are too large, ensuring that the chat runs smoothly. In addition, libraries like emoji-mart provide a rich emoji selection that enhances the interactive experience. Our development also benefits from tools like Cursor and Lovable, which offer advanced coding assistance and help generate parts of the web application more efficiently, further speeding up development time and maintaining a high standard of quality.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a top priority for our Family Chat Application. Passwords are stored securely using bcrypt hashing and all sensitive communications are protected with JWT-based authentication and HTTPS encryption. To prevent abuse, we include measures like rate limiting on login attempts and robust input validation to safeguard against malicious data. Performance is also a key focus: using Socket.io for real-time messaging ensures that updates to the chat are delivered instantly, and input fields autoscroll smoothly without interruption. These choices create a secure and responsive environment that maintains a high-quality user experience even under heavy usage.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technology choices made for our Family Chat Application come together to create a secure, responsive, and user-friendly platform. The combination of React with TypeScript on the frontend, along with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend, ensures that the application is both robust and scalable. Real-time communication is efficiently handled with Socket.io, while third-party integrations like Cloudinary and emoji-mart enhance the user experience by providing rich media support and interactive elements. Overall, these technologies work in harmony to meet our primary goal: enabling families to communicate in a safe, engaging, and reliable chat environment.
